        description: "Traffic congestion is a persistent challenge in major cities. Our innovative solution leverages edge detection to extract vital traffic data from CCTV footage. Instead of relying on manual traffic control, our system captures images from cameras stationed at junctions, transferring them to a database. These images are then processed to calculate traffic density. By setting a threshold for vehicle count, the system intelligently determines the duration of green and red lights at signals. This not only optimizes traffic flow but also significantly reduces the need for manual manpower, ensuring a more efficient and responsive traffic management system.",
